Hey everyone, I'm back with more code projects!

Last Friday, June 20th, I got bored of my monotonous summer routine and have chosen to work atleast 15 hours on 4 different projects this week.

This To-Do App is the first of four other projects that I will be releasing this week!

I've wanted to make one for ages but have never found the time so I glued myself to my chair (figuratively) and worked on this for 17 hours from 4 PM on June 21st to 9 AM on June 22nd. (15 hours of pure coding!)

I re-learnt a lot of python and customtkinter for this project.

While I really want to add more things, I'm getting super sleepy and I can feel my work getting sloppy and I really don't want to produce a messy product.

(In hindsight, I should've drank some tea lmao.)

Anyways, thank you so much for showing interest in this! I hope you love my app.
